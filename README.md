# Monday Tickets Analytics
This is a demo build of a web-application that was used internally at REPLI LLC. The production build of this web-app was built with the Monday.com API and React.js. To ensure data security for previous clients the demo build uses publically sourced data from residential communities. Due to Monday.com's "individual plan" limitations, all file data is being pushed to a MongoDB Cloud cluster and Next.js is being used to render the client side.

## Builds 
* Production Branch: Monday.com API and React.js 
* Main Branch: Next.js, Exported CSV, MonogoDB Cluster
